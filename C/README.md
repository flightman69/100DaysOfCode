# Starting With C Language 
# started on 1/11/2021
# I'll be following guide grom geeksforgeeks also the book Head First C
# The progress will uploaded to my github page https://github.com/flightman69 and also I'll update my progress in twitter @flightman69

 
Why C ?

1. I wanted to learn C language
2. I like the way how even after 50 years no language can completely replace C 
3. I already a hardcopy of Head First C by Griffths 
4. I'll be learning C in my College

# Day 11 quit geeksforgeeks since, reading 2 guide a time is bit confusing, I thaught learning 2 guides will give me two different pov but geeksforgeeks is not quite well written. So I'll be sticking with my Head First C book
