Learnt C standards like c99 c11 ANSI 'ISO C'

Difference between compilers

Took a deep look at int datatype in C #1 sign bit 31 data bit

int is a 4 byte (32 bit) data type where 1 bit assigned to sign (+ or -)
and the rest 31 bit is assigned to store data 

learnt few things about starting point of C program (int main {})
it's no good to use 'void main()' or juse 'main()'
